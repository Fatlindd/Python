# Python Exercises

In this repository, I put python tasks that I practice every day. I publish in this repository only the tasks that are more challenging and interesting, often we learn from a task with 3 or 4 lines of code, which we needed maybe 7-8 lines to complete. Big things are made of a series of small things put together, which we in python will know as modules.
